so this app directory is the one we use as backend experimental but new and awesome 


layout file has children which it shows the children fcome from 
page.js which is the one we make changes like App.js

global.css is where all the global css go

for routing we dont need react-router-dom we just need to create a folder in App folderand
there we need to create a folder called About(whatever route we want) and we need to create a Page.js file
as it works as index.js file and that's it

here all css will be  pure css and its in styles folder and we can use '@/app/styles/navbar.module.css


Image and Link work as components in nextjs too and that Css we use as styles.main_component
import Image from 'next/image'    for image src alt width height necessary
import Link from 'next/link'        href needed


we can use Layout and we can set Header and  Footer there without having to write Header footer for all pages

for fonts we can use import {Mulish } from next/fonts/google

we can use this in Layout page <html where it calls the styles.Mulish, btw fonts has two types variable and static, variable doesnt need to have fontweight but the static need to have fontweight written to work
we can use this anywhere where the styles not applied like button tag in html

we can use dynamic routing , we need to create a [id] folder and insdie create a page.js which we use to use for dynamic routing 
and call from the movie page to this /movie/dsfsdf link then it redirects here

for loading effect use loading.io and copy the css from it add it to your className 
for curvy effect in the background use the shapedivider.app whwere select your preferred css and svg and copy and paste it

the code we did till now we didnt use browser specific stuff like hooks onclick onchange so this is server component ,for making it client ocmponent we need to tell nextjs thatits
"use client" at the top

so we change nextjs.config.js for adding mongooose and other components we need extra 

we create models where schema and model exists and utils in which dbconnection exists and we use it using fetch the api/contact/ where route.js where we call dbconn and model and then in contactform where we call the backend we fetch and then method POST and then passing headers and data

for throwing all of the nav in small screen display none first the icons and then when screen begins less than 900 px then we can display them and transofmr translateX(100%) which pushes all of the items aside
